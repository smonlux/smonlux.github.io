        <h2>Seattle Regulations</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Affordability in housing is one of the biggest issues we face in Seattle today. The City of Seattle has identified the need for providing a mix of housing types at prices accessible to people at all levels of income, both for homeowners and renters. Backyard cottages, or Detached Accessory Dwelling Units (DADUs,) and in-law apartments, or Attached Accessory Dwelling Units (AADUs), have the potential to provide a significant amount of more affordable options for housing in neighborhoods where homes are often unaffordable to many people. If just 5% of eligible lots in the city build DADUs it would create about 4,000 housing units. There are relatively few backyard cottages in Seattle right now. In May of 2016, the Seattle City Council released a proposal that would make it easier for more homeowners to build backyard cottages and mother-in-law units in Seattle and provide more housing options for Seattle renters.

          <h2>Quick Start Guide </h2>
          <p>Cast Architecture has put together a guide to help homeowners better understand Seattle's citywide backyard cottage ordinance and the opportunities available to them.

            The first step is to figure out whether or not your lot is large enough to qualify for a backyard cottage. The chart below outlines the minimum requirements for lot area and dimensions.

          <p>The next step is to figure out what portion of your lot is buildable under the backyard cottage ordinance. Setbacks, yard requirements and maximum lot coverage all factor into whether or not a cottage is feasible.
