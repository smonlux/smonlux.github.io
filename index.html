      <p>This year, we become empty nesters. No time like the present to start a new project. I have always wanted to design and build a small home for our backyard. Looking at the benefits, my husband also likes the idea. So we're now seriously exploring the option, and may actually start the project within 5 years.</p>
      <p>Why a backyard cottage? Aside from the design and build satisfaction, we think there will be many benefits to building a second house on our property.</p>
